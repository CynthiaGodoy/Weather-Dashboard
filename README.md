## Items completed in Project

✅ Create a weather app with a form input to search for a specific city.

✅ When a specific city is searched it is then saved on the Local Storage and will be saved under the search history.

✅ When a specific city and a date is entered an icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index will be displayed.

✅ When the UV index is viewed a color will indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

✅ When future weather conditions are viewed for that city a 5-day forcast will display the date, an icon representation of conditions, temperature, wind speed, and the humidity.

✅ When a city in the search history is clicked, then current and future conditions for that city are presented.
